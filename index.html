                <p>When we plan the kitchen, we notice that the sink is more important than we think at first. We need a sink not only for rinsing, but also for washing fruit and vegetables, draining pasta, cleaning, soaking, wringing, draining...
                </p>
                <p>Before the purchase, the dilemma is certainly big, as we decide between different versions; Double or single sink? With or without drainer? How big of a cabinet do I need for my new sink? These are just a few questions that need to be clarified before we review all the sinks on the market. The question of materials is actually even more crucial - and we can help you here. We will give you some key information for stainless steel sinks and granite sinks and we hope that we will contribute to an easier and correct decision.

                    <h3>Kitchen fittings
                    </h3>
                    <p>When choosing kitchen fittings for your sink, you must first ask yourself how big the sink is and how tall the dishes will be. If we choose a low kitchen faucet, we will have many problems when filling or washing the dishes, especially when they are only tall. That is why we always recommend choosing a kitchen faucet as high as possible. It is also good to pay attention to the color of the kitchen faucet, especially when choosing faucets for granite sinks, because a different color shade causes us a lot of bad mood.
                        When buying a kitchen faucet, check that the set includes both a set for installation and a set for connecting to the water supply, that is, you need 2 braided connecting pipes and a screw for attaching the faucet from the underside of the kitchen counter. In principle, there are no big differences between kitchen faucets, except for the shape, size and opening method, which means single- or double-handed fittings. Today, kitchen faucets with a shower are also very popular, which are very practical and useful when washing dishes or cleaning food.</p>

                    <h3>Granite sinks
                    </h3>
                    <p>Granite sinks are made from a combination of quartz sand and composite resin in a ratio of 80/20. In addition to their aesthetic value, they will impress you with their exceptional strength, withstand high temperatures, and offer you the option of choosing different color combinations. Granite sinks are suitable for all types of kitchens, and you can also choose it for your summer kitchen without hesitation.
                        Sinks made of artificial granite will delight you for many years and do not require special maintenance, as only regular cleaning is sufficient. We often hear the information that a white sink is more sensitive to dirt than, for example, a black one, which of course is not true, as both are made of exactly the same material. If you clean the white sink regularly, it will retain its shine throughout its use. However, if you are one of those for whom cleaning the sink is too much work, we still recommend a darker version, as the dirt will be less visible.</p>

                    <h3>Stainless steel sinks
                    </h3>
                    <p>We all know these sinks for sure, because these models have been available for as long as we can remember. The advantage is low weight and easy maintenance and cleaning. Stainless steel sinks are not as robust as sinks made of "granite", they are not always the optimal choice from an aesthetic point of view, but they are certainly attractive due to their lower price. Stainless steel sinks are susceptible to damage by sharp objects, as the surface gets scratched rather quickly, which later causes you a lot of bad mood. Another disadvantage that should be mentioned is the thin sheet, which is susceptible to twisting when placing heavier containers or pans.
                        The stainless steel sink is also available in many designs and you will easily find the best solution for your kitchen. They also differ in the thickness of the material, which is a very important factor, and it is always better to choose a stainless steel kitchen sink that is made of at least 0.5 mm thick sheet metal, and even better is 0.7 mm, since the thickness affects the robustness of the product itself.</p>
